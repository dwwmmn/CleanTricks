# CleanTricks
Binary Ninja plugin to clean up some common obfuscation techniques (dirty tricks).
There is an empty template included as well to be able to easily add your own, because there are many many obfuscations out there. However, often they get reused or slightly modified, and then it is useful to have a starting point/example.
Pull requests are very welcome.
